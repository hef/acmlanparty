    What is the ACM LAN Party?
    -------------------------
    
    The ACM LAN Party is a gaming event hosted by the Association of Computing Machinery(ACM) of the University of Illinois at Chicago. People bring their computers and play games against one another on the LAN. The ACM has hosted numerous LAN party events in the past, some having around 30 attendees from UIC and friends of UIC students. Gamers come and battle it out against one another. So if you think you have what it takes, come on out and show us your 1337 g4m1ng sk1ll2.
    
    What should I bring?
    --------------------
    
     * Computer: make sure that you pack your computer, don't wanna get to the LAN and discover it's not in your car. Remember to bring power cables as well. Laptops or small fragbox styled boxes are always a space saver, which equals more room and comfort for everybody. :)
     * Monitor: Although you may have a gigantic 21\" CRT monitor, space is limited. If possible bring a flat panel LCD monitor or something that fits nicely on a table, since you will be sharing the table with other gamers. The ACM also has some 19\" CRT monitors for people to use incase you don't want to lug a huge monitor around.
     * Power Strip: the ACM has plenty of these, feel free to leave yours at home.
     * Headphones: Listen to your own sounds while you frag with your headphones. If you decide to bring speakers please be considerate of other gamers and keep the volume to a low level.
     * Ethernet Cable: we can always use more of this. It wouldn't be that good if you had all your gear and couldn't connect the LAN to frag some n3wb13z.
     * Input Devices: keyboard and mouse, the most essential tools of a 1337 gamer.
     * Software (Games): bring your huge cd case full of software. You never know when you might need to do a fresh install of that old Quake 3 game that's still sitting on your hard drive from 1999. Not to mention if something happens to your operating system enroute to the LAN party.
     * Money: we will be charging $10 at the door for non-ACM members, and $5 for pre-registered gamers and ACM members. This money will go towards ordering pizza.
    
    What games will be played?
    --------------------------
    
     * Team Fortress 2
     * Unreal Tournament 2004
     * Counterstrike: Source
     * Guitar Hero
     * Quake 3 Arena (Generations, Excessive (and Excessive Plus))
     * Quake 4
     * Doom 3
     * Call of Duty 1 and 2
     * Warcraft 3
     * Starcraft
     * Battlefield **42
     * Prey
    
    Plus, any other games that you can think of!
    
    What if I don't have any games?
    -------------------------------
    
    Don't worry, there's plenty of other people who won't have the same games either. There will be plenty of people there with the appropriate game demos and install files, so you shouldn't have a problem getting your hands on a copy of the demo. You can also go on ebay and try to find some cheaper versions of the games (quake 3, unreal tournament, etc.)
    Will there be food?
    
    There's a lot of restaurants, being on the edge of the Chicago loop and all. We will occasionally order pizza, there will also be other people who will want to order food as well, so you can always chip in and find someone else who is hungry and order something!
    
    Will there be stuff to drink?
    -----------------------------
    
    The ACM has been known to accept small donations ($.50) for the pop in their fridge. There will be a change bucket to drop your small donation off in. We usually have Coke, Mountain Dew, cream soda, root beer, Brisk, diet stuff, Hawaiian Punch, and the occasional box or two of bawls as well as some other stuff like bottled water.
    
    Where can I park while I'm at the LAN party?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    There is a parking garage located across Halsted from the SEL building, on the northeast corner of Halsted and Taylor. Parking will be $6.25 on the weekend for anything over an hour and a half($4.25 for a half hour to an hour and a half, any less time is $2.75).
    How do I get to the ACM LAN Party?
    For detailed instructions please check the directions page.
    
    Will there be consoles?
    -----------------------
    Anyone is welcome to bring their own console, however we do request that you talk to Joe first and let him know, so we don't have overlapping consoles being brought. Joe also plans on bringing is Wii, so if you haven't tried it you'll get your chance!
